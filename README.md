# VM_App_Launch_PoC


1)Open .sin project file in visual studio 2022 Community. 

2)In Solution Explorer, press "Setup" Directory, and then open in file explorer.

3) This will bring up a pop up window where you click on bin --> debug, then double click on folder debug. Selecting debug here will install the Main App (AppLaunchPoCMainApp) in your Programx86 directory, and the new protocol "customProtocol://site.com" should be registered and will allow for the app to be launched from the web at that request.
